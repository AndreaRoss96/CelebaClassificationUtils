# CelebaClassificationUtils
This small program uses PyGame to present the user with a range of images asking it to classify it based on Face orientation and Light source.
The commands are easy:
 - Left arrow key: left orientation / left light source
 - Right arrow key: right orientation / right light source
 - Down arrow key: central orientation / neutral light source
 - q key: quit
 - spacebar: skip image
 
 Quitting the program it will save a .csv file structured as a Pandas dataset where that can be easily imported in a python application.
 This program can be easily modified to work for every kind of image and attribute.
